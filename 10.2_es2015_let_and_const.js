//What is the difference between var and let?
    A Var declared variable is hoisted to the top of the document and can technically be called 
    before it has been declared a Let declared variable can only be called once it has been declared.

//What is the difference between var and const?
    A Var declared variable can be reassigned to any other value but a Const declared variable is 
    fixed to the value it is giving.

//What is the difference between let and const?
    A let declared variable can be modified i.e. added to or changed after it has been assigned but a 
    const variable can not be changed in any way

//What is hoisting?
    Hoisting is the process of variables being declared at the beginning of the scope 

var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!
    const PI = 3.14;
